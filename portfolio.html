        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm excited to be here today and have this opportunity to share more about myself. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to explore the world of coding.</p>
            
        <p>My Interests:
            My coding journey began with understanding how software can solve real-world problems. As time passes I became very interested in creating efficient and scalable solutions through programming. I have a particular passion for working on projects that allow me to combine my creativity with logic, such as building websites or building back-end systems.</p>
            
        <p>Skills:
            I have hands-on experience with many programming languages ​​and technologies, including Java, C, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. This has helped me gain a deeper understanding of various areas of development, from front-end design to back-end database logic. I learned Python to automate tasks and work with data, Java and C for core algorithm development, and HTML/CSS for web design. My knowledge of SQL helps me manage and query the database efficiently.</p>
            
        <p>I'm always eager to expand my skill set and learn new technologies, and I'm eager to get involved in projects where I can use my coding skills to make a meaningful impact. I am excited about the opportunity to work with your team and learn from the experiences this role can provide....</p>
